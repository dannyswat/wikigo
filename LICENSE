Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended
to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to
most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program
whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation
software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You
can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you
wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you
can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that
you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these
rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify
it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you
must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that
there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors'
sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that
their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous
versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.
This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom
to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the
area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most
unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit
the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in
other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in
future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States
should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on
general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special
danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively
take away the users' freedom to share and change the program. To prevent this,
the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
   placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the
   terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any
   such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the
   Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
   containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
   modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,
   translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)
   Each licensee is addressed as "you".

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
   covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
   the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered
   only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent
   of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends
   on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code
   as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
   disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
   License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients
   of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
   thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
   modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
   also meet all of these conditions:

   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
   that you changed the files and the date of any change.

   b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
   whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
   part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
   parties under the terms of this License.

   c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
   you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in
   the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including
   an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty
   (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
   redistribute the program under these conditions, and tell the user how
   to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is
   interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your
   work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
   Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections
   1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

   a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
   code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
   above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

   b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
   give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
   performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
   corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections
   1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

   c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
   distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only
   for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
   object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
   Subsection b above.)

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
   expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
   modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
   terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
   copies or rights from you under this License will not have their licenses
   terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
   However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
   Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if
   you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
   Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
   this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
   distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
   the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor
   to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and
   conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'  
   exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
   compliance by third parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement,
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)
   that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from
   the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
   simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
   obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
   For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
   of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
   you, then the only way you could distribute the Program would be to refrain
   entirely from distribution.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries
   either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder
   who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical
   distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
   permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this
   License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
   General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
   spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
   or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html for updates and the
   latest version.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose
    distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission.
    For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the
    Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will
    be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our
    free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

    NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
    PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
    STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM
    "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
    BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
    PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
    ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
    COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
    PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
    SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
    TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
    RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
    PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
