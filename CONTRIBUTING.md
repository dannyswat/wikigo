   cd wikigo
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/dannyswat/wikigo.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.23+
- Node.js 20+ and npm
- Git

### Backend (Go) Setup

```bash
cd server
go mod download
go mod verify
```

### Frontend (React) Setup

   ```

2. Run the backend:

   ```bash
   cd server
   go run ./cmd/web/main.go
   ```

3. Access the application at http://localhost:3000

## Making Changes

### Before You Start

1. Check existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplication
2. Create an issue to discuss major changes before implementing
3. Keep changes focused and atomic

### Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature/fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following our code style guidelines

3. Test your changes thoroughly

4. Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new diagram export feature"
   ```

## Submitting Changes

1. Push your branch to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Create a pull request from your fork to the main repository

3. Fill out the pull request template with:

   - Clear description of changes
   - Link to related issues
   - Screenshots (if applicable)
   - Testing notes

4. Respond to code review feedback promptly

## Code Style Guidelines

### Go Code

- Follow standard Go conventions (`go fmt`, `go vet`)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use proper error handling

### TypeScript/React Code

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
- Use meaningful component and variable names
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper prop types and interfaces

### General

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep line lengths reasonable
- Use consistent indentation (tabs for Go, 2 spaces for TypeScript)
- Remove trailing whitespace

## Testing

### Backend Testing

```bash
cd server
go test ./...
```

### Frontend Testing

```bash
cd client
npm test
```

### Manual Testing

- Test your changes in both development and production builds
- Verify functionality works with Docker deployment
- Test on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Ensure responsive design works on mobile devices

1. Check if the issue already exists
2. Use the appropriate issue template
3. Provide detailed information:
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
   - Expected vs actual behavior
